This is partly due to the price ... , but also the small size of the printers compared to traditional manufacturing.

            <h2>Welcome to My Final Project for CSD-112 Summer 2023</h2>
            <p>I wanted to really stretch my code writing skills in CSS and learn some new tricks but I fell into a recurring problem I have had with such a project (scope creep &amp; time management). Let me make a short list of the remaining issues with this project:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The first framework I planned to use became deprecated, so I had to abandon it. It was unfortunate since I was already familiar with it. Who would have thought that Google would turn its back on Materialize?</li>
                <li>I came across a highly reviewed Framework that seemed to have all the necessary components I needed. It claimed to use HTML and CSS with very little JS. However, I later discovered that it was created by a college student in Seattle. Not all of the CSS implementations I required were working, and despite a growing list of documented fixes and workarounds, I had to abandon it after investing 20 hours of work. I couldn't get away from it fast enough.</li>
                <li>I tried using three different frameworks for my project. The third one was supposed to be the most advanced and made use of the latest HTML and CSS features. However, I faced the same problem with this framework as well - the Models did not work with a sticky footer when the scroll bar was activated. Although someone wrote an add-on to fix this, it did not work well. After wasting tens of hours, I decided to write my own code to make both the Models and the sticky footer work together seamlessly.</li>
                <li>The 35 ~40 hours of productive work I have into this web page has yielded a Fully responsive website, a Sticky Header and Footer, a Scrollable Timeline, and a page with a ridiculous number of Modals embedded into nested Accordions (to the tune of almost 1,000 lines of HTML code for just that one page.</li>
                <li>If you look through all the pages, you'll notice that some of them only have placeholders for content that I haven't added yet.</li>
                <li>On a brighter note, I did learn about 'calc' in CSS and used it very effectively to match the width of an element to the responsive nature of dynamically changing website dimensions.</li>
                <li>I did my best to try not to write too much JS but there are about 100 lines of code there, the rest came with the framework.</li>
                <li>I almost forgot I have a contact Button in the sticky footer for all pages that launches a Modal with a form for contact. I just didn't get around to doing any validations ... I prefer to do that with Regex and JS anyway ...</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I welcome any criticisum but please be kind ...</p>
