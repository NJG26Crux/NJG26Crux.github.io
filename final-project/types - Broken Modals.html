                <h2>Types</h2>
                <h6><p>this content was from <a href="https://all3dp.com/1/types-of-3d-printers-3d-printing-technology/">all3dp.com</a></p></h6>
                <p>A challenge that many newcomers to 3D printing face is distinguishing between the different types of 3D printing processes. The uninitiated think of 3D printing as strings of plastic extruded from a hot nozzle and stacked up into a shape, but it’s so much more!</p>
                <p>In fact, 3D printing, also called additive manufacturing, is an umbrella term covering several very distinct 3D printing processes using completely different machines and materials.</p>
                <p>The types of additive manufacturing can be divided by what they produce or which type of material they use, but to apply structure to the technology worldwide, the International Standards Organization (ISO) divided them into seven general types:</p>
                
                <h4 class="h4-css">MATERIAL EXTRUSION</h4>
                <div class="types-group row">
                    <div class="columns small-8">
                        <p>Material extrusion is exactly what it sounds like: material being extruded through a nozzle. Typically, the material is a plastic filament pushed through a heated nozzle that near-melts it in the process. The printer deposits the material on a build platform along a path determined by the build preparation software. The filament then cools and solidifies to form a solid object. This is the most common form of 3D printing.</p>

                <ul class="ul-css">
                    <li>Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</li>
                    <p>FDM, like all 3D printing technology, starts with a digital model that is then translated into instructions for the 3D printer to follow. With FDM, a filament (or several at a time) on a spool is loaded into the 3D printer and fed through to a printer nozzle in the extrusion head. The printer nozzle, or nozzles, are heated to the desired temperature causing the filament to soften so that consecutive layers will join to create a solid part.</p>
                    <p>As the printer moves the extrusion head along the specified coordinates on the XY plane, it proceeds to lay down the first layer. The extrusion head then raises to the next level height (the Z plane), and this process of printing cross-sections is repeated, building layer upon layer until the object is fully formed.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the object’s geometry, it is sometimes necessary to add support structures to hold up the model as it’s printed, for example, if a model has steep overhanging parts. These supports are removed after printing. Some support structure material can be dissolved in water or another solution.</p>
                    <li>3D Bioprinting</li>
                    <p>3D bioprinting, or bio 3D printing, is an additive manufacturing process where organic or biological materials, such as living cells and nutrients, are combined to create natural tissue-like three-dimensional structures. In other words, bioprinting is a type of 3D printing that can potentially produce anything from bone tissue and blood vessels to living tissues. It’s used for various medical research and applications, including tissue engineering, drug testing and development, and in innovative regenerative medicine therapies.</p>
                    <li>Construction 3D Printing</li>
                    <p>Construction 3D printing is a rapidly growing area of material extrusion. The technology involves using extremely large-scale 3D printers, often measuring tens of meters high, to extrude building material, such as concrete, from a nozzle. These machines generally come either as gantry or robotic arm systems.</p>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="h4-css">VAT POLYMERIZATION</h4> 
                <div class="types-group row">
                    <div class="columns small-8">
                        <p>Vat polymerization (also called resin 3D printing) is a family of 3D printing processes that uses a light source to selectively cure (or harden) photopolymer resin in a vat. In other words, light is precisely directed to a specific point or area of the liquid plastic to harden it. Once the first layer is cured, the build platform is moved up or down (depending on the printer) by a small amount (typically between 0.01 and 0.05 mm), and the next layer is cured, joining the previous one. This process is repeated layer by layer until the 3D part is formed.</p>
                        <p>After the 3D printing process is done, the object is cleaned to remove the remaining liquid resin and post-cured (either in sunlight or a UV chamber) to enhance the mechanical properties of the part.</p>

                <ul class ="ul-css">
                    <li>Stereolithography (SLA)</li>
                    <p>An SLA printer uses mirrors, known as galvanometers or galvos, with one positioned on the X-axis and another on the Y-axis. These galvos rapidly aim a laser beam (or two) across a vat of resin, selectively curing and solidifying a cross-section of the object inside this building area, building it up layer by layer.</p>
                    <p>As each layer is cured in just the right places, it then moves up (almost imperceptively) to pull out the hardened resin layer and make space for another liquid layer that will then be cured by the laser.</p>
                    <ul class="ul-css">
                        <li>Microstereolithography (µSLA)</li>
                        <p>Just like it sounds, this version of SLA in the vat polymerization family, prints parts on the micro-scale, or resolutions between 2 microns (µm) and 50 microns. For reference, the average width of a human hair is 75 microns. It’s one of the so-called “Micro 3D Printing” technologies. µSLA involves exposing photosensitive material (liquid resin) to an ultraviolet laser. The difference is the specialized resins, the sophistication of the lasers, and the addition of lenses, which generate almost unbelievably small points of light.</p>
                        <li>Two-Photon Polymerization (TPP)</li>
                        <p>TPP uses a pulsed femtosecond laser focused into a tight spot in a vat of special resin. This spot is then used to cure individual 3D pixels, also known as voxels, in the resin. By sequentially curing these nano- to micrometer-small voxels layer by layer, in a predefined path, you can create 3D objects. These can be several millimeters large while maintaining the nanometer resolution.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Digital Light Processing (DLP)</li>
                    <p>DLP 3D printing uses a digital light projector (instead of a laser) to flash a single image of each layer all at once (or multiple flashes for larger parts) on a layer or resin.</p>
                    <p>DLP is (more often than SLA) used to produce larger parts or larger volumes of parts in a single batch since each layer flash takes exactly the same amount of time regardless of how many parts are in the build, which makes it generally faster than the laser method in SLA</p>
                    <ul class="ul-css">
                        <li>Projection Microstereolithography (PµSL)</li>
                        <p>PµSL uses ultraviolet light from a projector to cure layers of specially formulated resin at the micro-scale (2-micron resolution and down to a 5-micron layer height).</p>
                        <li>Lithography-based Metal Manufacturing (LMM)</li>
                        <p>In LMM, metal powder is homogeneously dispersed in a light-sensitive resin and then selectively polymerized by exposure with blue light via a projector. After printing, the “green” parts have their polymer component removed, leaving fully metal “brown” parts that are finished in a sintering process in a furnace. Feedstocks include stainless steel, titanium, tungsten, brass, copper, silver, and gold.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)</li>
                    <p>Liquid crystal display (LCD), also called masked stereolithography (MSLA), is very similar to DLP above, except, instead of a digital micromirror device (DMD) it uses an LCD screen, which has a noticeable impact on the 3D printer’s price.</p>
                    <p>Another difference between DLP-based printers and LCD technology is that the latter uses an array of hundreds of individual emitters rather than a single-point emitter light source like a laser diode or DLP bulb.</p>
                    <p class="types-css-accent1">Due to the low cost of LCD units, this technology has become the go-to technology for the budget desktop resin printer segment, but that doesn’t mean it’s not used professionally. Some industrial 3D printer makers are pushing the limits of the technology with impressive results.</p>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="h4-css">POWDER BED FUSION</h4>
                <p>Powder bed fusion 3D printers spread a thin layer of powdered material over the print bed, typically with a type of blade, roller, or wiper. Energy, typically from a laser, fuses specific points on the powder layer, then another powder layer is deposited and fused to the previous layer. The process repeats until the entire object is fabricated. The final item is encased and supported in unfused powder.</p>
                <ul class ="ul-css">
                    <li>Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</li>
                    <p>Selective laser sintering (SLS) creates objects out of plastic powder by using a laser. First, a bin of polymer powder is heated to a temperature just below the polymer’s melting point. Next, a recoating blade or wiper deposits a very thin layer of the powdered material – typically 0.1 mm thick – onto a build platform. A laser (CO2 or fiber) then begins to scan the surface according to the pattern laid out in the digital model. The laser selectively sinters the powder and solidifies a cross-section of the object.</p>
                    <p>When the entire cross-section is scanned, the build platform moves down one layer thickness in height. The recoating blade deposits a fresh layer of powder on top of the recently scanned layer, and the laser will sinter the next cross-section of the object onto the previously solidified cross-sections.</p>
                    <ul class="ul-css">
                        <li>Micro Selective Laser Sintering (μSLS)</li>
                        <p>In μSLS, a layer of metal nanoparticle ink is coated onto a substrate and then dried to produce a uniform nanoparticle layer. Next, laser light that has been patterned using a digital micromirror array is used to heat and sinter the nanoparticles into the desired patterns. This set of steps is then repeated to build up each layer of the 3D part in the μSLS system.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF)</li>
                    <p>As a subtype of powder bed fusion, LPBF involves a bed of metal powder and a high-powered laser or several (up to 12). LPBF 3D printers use lasers to selectively fuse metal powder together layer-by-layer on a molecular basis until the model is complete. LPBF is a highly precise and accurate method of 3D printing and is commonly used for creating complex metal parts for aerospace, medical and industrial applications.</p>
                    <p>LPBF machines use common engineering alloys, such as stainless steels, nickel superalloys, and titanium alloys. There are dozens of metals available for the LPBF process.</p>
                    <li>Electron Beam Melting (EBM)</li>
                    <p>EBM, also called electron beam powder bed fusion (EB PBF), is a 3D printing method for metals similar to LPBF but uses an electron beam instead of a fiber laser. This technology is used to manufacture parts, such as titanium orthopedic implants, turbine blades for jet engines, and copper coils.</p>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="h4-css">MATERIAL JETTING</h4>
                <p>Material jetting is a 3D printing process where tiny droplets of material are deposited and then solidified or cured on a build plate. Using photopolymers or wax droplets that cure when exposed to light, objects are built up, one layer at a time.</p>
                <p>The nature of the material jetting process allows for different materials to be printed in the same object. One application of this technique is fabricating parts in multiple colors and textures.</p>
                <ul class ="ul-css">
                    <li>Material Jetting (M-Jet)</li>
                    <p>Material jetting (M-Jet) for polymers is a 3D printing process where a layer of photosensitive resin is selectively deposited onto a build plate and cured with ultraviolet (UV) light. After one layer has been deposited and cured, the build platform is lowered down one layer thickness, and the process is repeated to build up a 3D object.</p>
                    <p>M-Jet combines the outstanding detail of resin 3D printing with speeds better than filament 3D printing (FDM) to create parts and prototypes in true-to-life color and texture.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul class ="ul-css">
                        <li>Aerosol Jet</li>
                        <p>Electronic inks are placed into an atomizer, which creates a dense mist of material-laden droplets between 1 to 5 microns in diameter. The aerosol mist is then delivered to the deposition head, where it is focused by a sheath gas, which results in a high-velocity particle spray.</p>
                        <li>Plastic Freeforming </li>
                        <p>It uses commercially available plastic granulates that are melted as in the injection molding process and moved to the discharge unit. A high-frequency nozzle closure generates rapid opening and closing movements of up to 200 tiny droplets of plastic per second with a diameter between 0.2 and 0.4 mm. The droplets are bonded with the hardened material as they cool down.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <li>NanoParticle Jetting (NPJ)</li>
                    <p> Uses an array of printheads with thousands of inkjet nozzles that simultaneously jet millions of ultrafine drops of materials onto a build tray in ultrathin layers while simultaneously jetting a support material. Metal or ceramic particles are suspended in the liquid. The process occurs under high heat, which evaporates the liquid upon jetting, leaving mostly just the metal or ceramic material. The resulting 3D part has only a small amount of bonding agent remaining that’s removed in a sintering post-process.</p>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="h4-css">BINDER JETTING</h4>
                <p>Whether metal, plastic, sand, or another powdered material, the binder jetting process is essentially the same. First, a recoating blade or roller spreads a thin layer of powder over the build platform. Then, a printhead with inkjet nozzles passes over the bed, selectively depositing droplets of a binding or fusing agent to bond the powder particles together. When the layer is complete, the build platform moves downwards and the blade or roller recoats the surface. The process then repeats until the whole part is complete. The parts are encased in a bed of powder material and need to be dug out. The excess powder is collected and can be reused.</p>
                <p>Binder jetting is fast and has high production rates, so it can produce large volumes of parts more cost-effectively than other AM methods. Metal binder jetting, used with a wide range of metals, is popular for end-use consumer products, tools, and volume spare parts. Cold polymer binder jetting has limited material options and produces parts with low structural properties, but variations with heat typically use nylon and TPU.</p>
                <ul class ="ul-css">
                    <li>Metal Binder Jetting</li>
                    <p>Metal binder jetting is a very appealing technology for volume metal part production and to achieve lightweighting. Because binder jetting can print parts with complex pattern infills instead of being solid, the resulting parts are dramatically lighter while being as strong. Binder jetting’s porosity feature can also be used to achieve lighter end parts for medical applications, such as implants.</p>
                    <p>After printing and removing the parts from the bed of metal powder (a process called depowdering) some processes include a thermal curing stage before they’re heat-treated in a furnace (a process called sintering). Both the printing parameters and the sintering parameters are tuned for the specific part geometry, material, and desired density. Bronze or another metal is sometimes used to infiltrate the voids in a binder jetted part, resulting in zero porosity.</p>
                    <li>Plastic Binder Jetting (MJF, HSS, SAF)</li>
                    <p>Polymer binder jetting begins with a polymer powder (usually a type of nylon) spread across a build platform in a thin layer. Then inkjet heads dispense a binder-like glue (and/or other fluids, including colored inks, fusible or radiation absorbing fluids, and magnetic fluids) precisely where the polymer should be joined on each layer.</p>
                    <p>Binder jetting variations without heat can be infilled with another material to boost strength. These cold binder jetting processes are also the ones that include colored inks and can produce multi-color parts used in medical modeling and product prototypes</p>
                    <li>Sand Binder Jetting</li>
                    <p>Sand binder jetting is arguably not a distinct technology from plastic binder jetting but the printers and applications are different enough to earn a separate entry here. In fact, producing large sand-casting molds, models, and cores is one of the most common uses for binder jetting technology.</p>

                <h4 class="h4-css">DIRECTED ENERGY DEPOSITION</h4>
                <p>Directed Energy Deposition (DED) is a 3D printing process where metal material is fed and fused by powerful energy as the same time that it’s deposited. This is one of the broadest categories of 3D printing, encompassing a long list of subcategories depending on the form of the material (wire or powder) and the type of energy (laser, electron beam, electric arc, supersonic speed, heat, etc.).</p>
                <p>The technology is prized as a faster and cheaper replacement for casting and forging metal parts in small quantities and for critical repair for applications in the offshore oil and gas industry, as well as in the aerospace, power generation, and utility industries.</p>
                <ul class ="ul-css">
                    <li>Laser Directed Energy Deposition</li>
                    <p>Laser Directed Energy Deposition (L-DED), also called laser metal deposition (LMD) or Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS), is a 3D printing technology using a metal powder or wire fed through one or more nozzles and fused via a powerful laser on a build platform or on a metal part. An object is built up layer by layer as the nozzle and laser move or as the part moves on a multiple-axis turntable.</p>
                    <li>Electron Beam Directed Energy Deposition</li>
                    <p>Electron beam DED, also called wire electron beam energy deposition, is a 3D printing process very similar to DED with a laser. It is carried out in a vacuum chamber, which produces very clean, high-quality metal. As a metal wire is fed through one or more nozzles, it is fused by an electron beam. Layers are built up individually, with the electron beam creating a tiny melt pool and the weld wire fed into the melt pool by a wire feeder.</p>
                    <li>Wire Directed Energy Deposition</li>
                    <p>Wire Directed Energy Deposition, also known as Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), is 3D printing that uses energy in the form of plasma or wire arc to melt metal in wire form where it’s deposited layer on top of layer by a robotic arm onto a surface, such as a multi-axis turntable, to form a shape.</p>
                    <li>Cold Spray</li>
                    <p>Cold spray is a DED 3D printing technology that sprays metal powders at supersonic speeds to bond them without melting them, which produces almost no thermal stress that can produce hot-cracking or other common problems that can affect melt-based technologies.</p>
                    <li>Molten Direct Energy Deposition</li>
                    <p>Molten Direct Energy Deposition is a 3D printing process that uses heat to melt (or near melt) metal, usually aluminum, then deposit it on a build plate layer by layer to form a 3D object.</p>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="h4-css">SHEET LAMINATION</h4>
                <p>Sheet lamination is technically a form of 3D printing, although it differs dramatically from the technologies above. It functions by stacking and laminating sheets of very thin material together to produce a 3D object or a stack that’s then cut mechanically or with lasers to form the final shape.</p>
                <ul class ="ul-css">
                    <li>Laminated Additive Manufacturing</li>
                    <p>Laminating is a 3D printing technology where sheets of material are layered on top of each other and bonded together using glue then a knife (or laser, or CNC router) is used to cut the layered object into the correct shape.</p>
                    <ul class ="ul-css">
                        <li>Viscous Lithography Manufacturing (VLM)</li>
                        <p>Laminates thin layers of high-viscosity photosensitive resins onto a transparent transfer film. The mechanical system allows the resin to be laminated from both sides of the film, making it possible to combine different resins to get multi-material parts and easy-to-remove support structures.</p>
                        <li>Composite Based Additive Manufacturing (CBAM)</li>
                        <p>Fuses mats of carbon, glass, or Kevlar with a thermoplastic to create parts.</p>
                        <li>Selective Lamination Composite Object Manufacturing (SLCOM)</li>
                        <p>Uses thermoplastics as a base material and woven fiber composites. It’s uncertain if Desktop Metal still supports this method.</p>
